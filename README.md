# nebula - A digital garden for the ages

This is a from-scratch rewrite of my site currently at [raleighwi.se](https://raleighwi.se), tough that domain will be gone as soon as it expires.

## Design
The philosphy and insipiration are in [`design/ideas`](core.md) and there are some krita scribbles in the `design`folder as well. [`design/technical`](design/technical) follows the technical side of the project, with the software (I will be writing my own static site generator!) and webdev stuff going there, and [`design/art`](design/art) will follow the artistic side of site design. If I ever get this running on hardware I own I'll make a page for that aswell.

## Licensing
The raw code for this site sits under an Unlicense, and the content (anything other than raw source code, so art, text, music, etc.) is under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
