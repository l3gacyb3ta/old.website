# Nebulous software!
## Software for nebula

nebula needs a whole lot of software. And it's all here! I have used crystal to build most of the software, becuase I love writing stuff in it, it just _flows_. Anywhoooo who's interested in learning crystal, I suggest you check out [crystal-lang.org](https://crystal-lang.org/). carina is built in bash because I needed to learn how to write bash scripts, and this seemed like the best solution! 

## Components:
- `./starport`: The build system for nebula.
- `./helix`: My custom Static Site Generator that builds markdown into the HTML.
- `./carina`: A script and fish completions for it to help me make content.
