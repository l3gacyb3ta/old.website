# vangaurd - a stupid build system

Please dont use this.  
But if you do:
## vangaurd config
All vangaurd configs are saved in a projects `.vangaurd.toml`.
Write 
Here is a full example, I'll anotate this later: <TODO>
```toml
[dependencies]
    packages = [
        "crystal",
        "shards"
    ]

    binary_downloads = ["https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/didder/releases/download/v1.1.0/didder_1.1.0_linux_64-bit", "didder"]

[source]
    dir = "."

[build]
    main = """
    shards build
    """
    install = """
    cp ./bin/didder ./.vangaurd/bin/
    """
```

`[source]` currently only accepts dir, but in the future I plan to add git and even tarballs.

## .vangaurd folder
`.vangaurd` is a folder that contains all the files vangaurd generates (binaries, currently).
After the `install` phase of `[build]`, the `.vangaurd/install` folder is copied to `~/.local/bin`.

## Why vangaurd?
Vangaurd is the name of the first rockets the US made to deliver payloads to orbit, and vangaurd delivers binaries to the nebula!
