# Stickers - Random Thoughts
![My stickers!](/static/stickers.png)
I'm going to start a little series of random thought posts, so enjoy the first.

Stickers are such a staple in hacker culture, and I'm on a car ride without internet, so let me just talk about s t i c k e r s.

## Why do we like them?

Well, what are stickers? Stickers are an easy to make and use object that can have almost any design. 
I have a ton! They are fun and colorful and are pretty on a laptop or phone.  

## But like _why_?

For me, and for many people I know, stickers are like a poster board of identity. When you think about it, they're weird.
When you're using a device you aren't looking at the side with stickers (unless you're doing something _very_ wrong),
so the stickers are less for you (even though they look amazing), and more for the others around you.  

That's why we love stickers. They are a way to broadcast who are you are and what you stand for. They're little posters for your devices!
