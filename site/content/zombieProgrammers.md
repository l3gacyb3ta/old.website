Roland Barthes was 20th century french literary theorist, someone who talks about how books _work_.
One of his most major contributions to his field was that of "The Death of The Author"
(French: "ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·La mort de l'auteurðŸ¥–"). This concept proposes that once a work has been written, the
author can be considered "dead" for the purpose of critique and examination, because the text remains
the same, no matter what the author does next. Another point of his is that 

> ## Why is code not a book? They both suck to write.

> ## And who wrote that code :eyes:

> ## Why should I care? Programmers are just programmers.

## In the end...
