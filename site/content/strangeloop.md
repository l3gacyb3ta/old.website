# First and Last Strange Loop, and onto the future!

I'm going to run through this chronologically, because I cannot figure out a better way to do that :3

## Day -1 (Wednesday 20/09/23)

I flew in on Wednesday, with my amazing mom in tow, at around 4PM. We had fun walking around downtown St. Louis, and had some underwhelming Tex-Mex. It was quite nice out, yet somehow 
warmer than back home in Atlanta, which was wild.

## Day 0 (Thursday 21/09/23)

As I got to the bueatiful Stifel Theater, where the opening and closing keynotes were held, I was admitedly a fair bit lost. Passing through the lobby on the way to the opening keynote, 
one thing that suprised me was the fact that Coca-Cola products weren't the only drinks at the event. That might seem wierd to most of you, but coming from Atlanta, I don't think
I've seen a place or event with any Pepsi product in a 50 mile radius of the magnificently oppulent "World Of Coke" in downtown ATL.

The opening keynote was lead by [Taylor Poindexter](https://www.poindexter.dev/) from Spotify, and [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) from Microsoft. 
While funny, I found most of the advice less than radical, albeit helpful. For example, the idea that **feedback without trust is not feedback** is a very good way to frame why
life advice can feel mean from someone you don't know, and can feel very helpful from someone you do. 

After that, I went back out to the lobby for the 15 minutes before AnnMarie Thomas' keynote. I had been chatting on the Strange Loop slack a bit, and had run into one of my favorite
"coding" content creators, [Lu Wilson](https://github.com/TodePond). Their [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TodePond) is something you *must* check out,
it's an amazing blend of aesthetics, cool concepts, and amazing code. They saw me, and pulled me into their group! It was them and a couple of their coworkers from [tldraw](https://tldraw.com),
as well as [Max Bitter](https://maxbittker.com), an amazingly sweet and incredibly smart human like all of that group. 

Following along with that group, I went to see [AnnMarie Thomas](https://www.annmarie-thomas.com/)' keynote, which was super cool! She sumarizes play as needing the following components:

- [ ]: Meet new people
- [ ]: Have an element of whismy
- [ ]: Create joy in the participants
- [ ]: Have the element of suprise!

I like this formulation, as well as her emphasis on how play doesn't necesarily the mean the person organizing the play is having "fun", as it's an important job.
Also, it was super fun to realize in the middle of the talk that I knew her work on SquishyCircuits, from the book [The Art of Tinkering](https://www.exploratoriumstore.com/products/the-art-of-tinkering?variant=2827613444)
published by the Exploratorium in San Fransico.
