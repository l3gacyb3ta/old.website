# hedonism

[ In response to someone saying their writing was meaningless]
Isn't everything, in the end?
We exist for a mere microsecond on a cosmic scale, and are remembered for little more
How many people do you know from ancient egypt? Like 1 or 2, out of millions. 
Odds are you'll be forgotten and insignificant.
So have fun! Do what you want! Make your life mean something to you and those you love.
Maximize for your pleasure while minimizing others suffering!
So if your writing is meaningless, who cares? You had fun writing it!
 Others enjoyed reading it! It was good!


I personally call this approach to life Hedonistic Nihilism, which is just really
 fun to say, and a great philosophy if I do say so myself.
