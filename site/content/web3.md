My (not so) first thoughts on web3
==================================

![web3 software](/static/web3.png)


Since this seems to be a sort of trend in the online spaces I inhabit, thought
I might join in!

what even is web3?
------------------ 

How I like to think about web3 is in terms of Web 2.0 and Web 1,
so what were those?

### Web 1

Most people consider the internet to have been invented in 1983, as that is the
year that the standard of TCP/IP (Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork
Protocol) was formalized, creating a standard way of sending data from computer
to computer. Web 1 was characterized by static, informative content.

Now why would people build such a boring internet? Well, they were academics,
sooooo.

### Web 2.0

Web 2 is considered to have started in the mid to late 90s, when technologies
like PHP and MySQL solidified. Web 2 is the "interactive web," where users 
started _creating_ content instead of just consuming. One of my favorite
examples of this is WikiPedia, where users created litterally billions of words
of content.

### and into the future!

Web 3.0 was originally considered to be the "semantic web," that is, an internet 
where the content itself is machine parseable and easily contextulized. That's a
whole bunch of buzzwords for basically "look at this data, this data is
related!" The idea was created by the _creator of HTTP himself_ 
[Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/), an idea I love, and
if you do too, then look into the IndieWeb!

And then cryptobros came along.

## Modern web3
web3 (yes it's lowercase, which I will use to separate it from Web 3), is like 
worse late Web 1. Also it's a terrifying capitalist hell. 

### "modern" Web 1
web3 is mostly based around cryptocurrencies, I'm not going to say blockchain
because blockchain tech itself is amazing, but cryptocurrencies are an ancaps
wet dream (that's bad FYI).

Here are some of the base protocols, technologies, and concepts:
- Cryptocurrency:
	A type of currenency where, hear me out this is gonna get ~ economical ~,
	the value is derived from the decentralized trust model. That's a #bigbrain
	way to say that people think it has value because math and "no one owns it".
	
- NFTs:
	These are a great idea, in theory. NFTs are basically (for the most part), a
	reciept that points to a piece of art you own. Interestingly, in a lot of 
	casses you dont own the art. The good part of them is that a cut of every
	sale goes back to the artist. On the flip side of that, a lot of major NFTs
	aren't made by actual artists, and are just brands looking for a quick buck.

- Handshake and ENS:
	These are two seperate DNS services for the decentralized web, ignoring that
	projects like [OpenNIC](https://opennic.org) exist and don't burn the
	planet. Handshake is it's own blockchain, where as ENS is a suite of so
	called "smart contracts" on the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain.
	Both of these are Proof Of Work, which is a system that relies on solving 
	complex math problems, burning gigawatts of power a day. 

- IPFS 
	This is one of the few pieces of the web3 stack I am genuinely a fan of.
	[IPFS](https://ipfs.io) is a p2p (fancyspeak for 2 computers connecting to 
	eachother without needing someone orchestrating it) network where files are
	stored. I'm a fan of this one because it's not tied to some sort of currency
	to compensate for storage, you just pin the files you like and want to 
	support, and can have others pin yours! It's genuinely a great file system.

![metaverse](/static/meta.png)
In your average cryptobros mind, these can all come together to make some sort
of magical metaverse of happy capitalism wonderland.
	
#### Immutable hell
One thing you might notice is that the majority of these protocols are static,
immutable, or store the entire history. This seems amazing right now, but with
exponentially more users and growth, the storage and compute requirements will
also rise exponentially, which makes sense from a Big Tech point of view, how
else would you sell more CPUs, more GPUs, more RAM, more SSDs. 

## A solution: Just stop, like really
![degrowth grafiti](/static/degrowth.png)
Theres's a solution that comes to us from the world of economics. It's called
Degrowth. With our current situation, quite a few people belive that the
solution to our issues with some things like climate change and the hell that is
work in our neoliberal economy. The core concept is moving backwards, slowing
down, and reversing. We can apply this to web3 aswell! We need to stop pushing
forwards on things like PoW cryptocurrencies and move back to Web 2 or 1 tech.

## What can I do?
I have no clue how to end posts, so enjoy this amazing call to action:
> Just go and like, ya know, steal some bitcoin mining GPUs and use them for 
> games.
