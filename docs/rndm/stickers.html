I'm going to start a little series of random thought posts, so enjoy the first.</p>
<p>Stickers are such a staple in hacker culture, and I'm on a car ride without internet, so let me just talk about s t i c k e r s.</p>
<h2>Why do we like them?</h2>
<p>Well, what are stickers? Stickers are an easy to make and use object that can have almost any design.
I have a ton! They are fun and colorful and are pretty on a laptop or phone.</p>
<h2>But like <em>why</em>?</h2>
<p>For me, and for many people I know, stickers are like a poster board of identity. When you think about it, they're weird.
When you're using a device you aren't looking at the side with stickers (unless you're doing something <em>very</em> wrong),
so the stickers are less for you (even though they look amazing), and more for the others around you.</p>
<p>That's why we love stickers. They are a way to broadcast who are you are and what you stand for. They're little posters for your devices!</p>
