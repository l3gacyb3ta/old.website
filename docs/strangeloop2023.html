<p>I'm going to run through this chronologically, because I cannot figure out a better way to do that :3</p>
<h2>Day -1 (Wednesday 20/09/23)</h2>
<p>I flew in on Wednesday, with my amazing mom in tow, at around 4PM. We had fun walking around downtown St. Louis, and had some underwhelming Tex-Mex. It was quite nice out, yet somehow
warmer than back home in Atlanta, which was wild.</p>
<h2>Day 0 (Thursday 21/09/23)</h2>
<p>As I got to the bueatiful Stifel Theater, where the opening and closing keynotes were held, I was admitedly a fair bit lost. Passing through the lobby on the way to the opening keynote,
one thing that suprised me was the fact that Coca-Cola products weren't the only drinks at the event. That might seem wierd to most of you, but coming from Atlanta, I don't think
I've seen a place or event with any Pepsi product in a 50 mile radius of the magnificently oppulent &quot;World Of Coke&quot; in downtown ATL.</p>
<p><div class='imgcontainer'><img alt='A description is directly below this image, prefaced by a tilde.' src="/static/me.png" /> <p class='image-alt'>~ "The Stifel Theater's amazing roof, including some cool projection art"</p></div></p>
<p>The opening keynote was lead by <a href="https://www.poindexter.dev/">Taylor Poindexter</a> from Spotify, and <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> from Microsoft.
While funny, I found most of the advice less than radical, albeit helpful. For example, the idea that <strong>feedback without trust is not feedback</strong> is a very good way to frame why
life advice can feel mean from someone you don't know, and can feel very helpful from someone you do.</p>
<p>After that, I went back out to the lobby for the 15 minutes before AnnMarie Thomas' keynote. I had been chatting on the Strange Loop slack a bit, and had run into one of my favorite
&quot;coding&quot; content creators, <a href="https://github.com/TodePond">Lu Wilson</a>. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TodePond">youtube channel</a> is something you <em>must</em> check out,
it's an amazing blend of aesthetics, cool concepts, and amazing code. They saw me, and pulled me into their group! It was them and a couple of their coworkers from <a href="https://tldraw.com">tldraw</a>,
as well as <a href="https://maxbittker.com">Max Bitter</a>, an amazingly sweet and incredibly smart human like all of that group.</p>
<p>Following along with that group, I went to see <a href="https://www.annmarie-thomas.com/">AnnMarie Thomas</a>' keynote, which was super cool! She sumarizes play as needing the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ]: Meet new people</li>
<li>[ ]: Have an element of whismy</li>
<li>[ ]: Create joy in the participants</li>
<li>[ ]: Have the element of suprise!</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this formulation, as well as her emphasis on how play doesn't necesarily the mean the person organizing the play is having &quot;fun&quot;, as it's an important job.
Also, it was super fun to realize in the middle of the talk that I knew her work on SquishyCircuits, from the book <a href="https://www.exploratoriumstore.com/products/the-art-of-tinkering?variant=2827613444">The Art of Tinkering</a>
published by the Exploratorium in San Fransico.</p>
