<p>Hedonism gets a bad rep. But it's my personal philosophy. I think I summarized it really well in this little passage:</p>
<h2>In response to someone saying their writing was meaningless</h2>
<p>Isn't everything, in the end?<br />
We exist for a mere microsecond on a cosmic scale, and are remembered for little more<br />
How many people do you know from ancient egypt? Like 1 or 2, out of millions.
Odds are you'll be forgotten and insignificant.<br />
So have fun! Do what you want! Make your life mean something to you and those you love.<br />
Maximize for your pleasure while minimizing others suffering!<br />
So if your writing is meaningless, who cares? You had fun writing it!<br />
Others enjoyed reading it! It was good!<br />
I personally call this approach to life Hedonistic Nihilism, which is just really<br />
fun to say, and a great philosophy if I do say so myself.</p>
<h2>Extra bits:</h2>
<p>I personnally get really happy seeing other people happy, so if you don't, maybe
try something other than hedonism, as you might hurt people.</p>
<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Now, of course, you have to be careful. Even if taking a drug would maximize happiness now,
over the long term it won't help. Same for STDs.</p>
<p>But, if done right, you get to have a really happy life!</p>
