<p>Since this seems to be a sort of trend in the online spaces I inhabit, thought
I might join in!</p>
<h2>what even is web3?</h2>
<p>How I like to think about web3 is in terms of Web 2.0 and Web 1,
so what were those?</p>
<h3>Web 1</h3>
<p>Most people consider the internet to have been invented in 1983, as that is the
year that the standard of TCP/IP (Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork
Protocol) was formalized, creating a standard way of sending data from computer
to computer, but that wouldn't be the beginning of the web.</p>
<p>Web 1 starts with Tim Berners-Lee. In 1989 he created HTTP (Hyper Text Transport
Protocol), a method of sending documents over the IP stack that we still use
today! Because of the rudimentary nature of this protocol, Web 1 was
characterized by static, informative content.
Now why would people build such a boring internet? Well, they were academics,
sooooo.</p>
<h3>Web 2.0</h3>
<p>Web 2 is considered to have started in the mid to late 90s, when technologies
like PHP and MySQL solidified. Web 2 is the &quot;interactive web,&quot; where users
started <em>creating</em> content instead of just consuming. One of my favorite
examples of this is Wikipedia, where users created literally billions of words
of content.</p>
<h3>and into the future!</h3>
<p>Web 3.0 was originally considered to be the &quot;semantic web,&quot; that is, an internet
where the content itself is machine parseable and easily contextualized. That's a
whole bunch of buzzwords for basically &quot;look at this data, this data is
related!&quot; The idea was created by the <em>the guy we talked about earlier</em>
<a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, an idea I love, and
if you do too, then look into the IndieWeb!</p>
<p><div class='imgcontainer'><img alt='A description is directly below this image, prefaced by a tilde.' src="/static/indie.png" /> <p class='image-alt'>~ "A whole bunch of IndieWeb protocols"</p></div></p>
<p>And then cryptobros came along.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Insert scary sound effects here</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Modern web3</h2>
<p>web3 (yes it's lowercase, which I will use to separate it from Web 3), is like
worse late Web 1. Also it's a terrifying capitalist hell.</p>
<h3>&quot;modern&quot; Web 1</h3>
<p>web3 is mostly based around cryptocurrencies, I'm not going to say blockchain
because blockchain tech itself is amazing, but cryptocurrencies are an ancaps
wet dream (that's bad FYI).</p>
<p>Here are some of the base protocols, technologies, and concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cryptocurrency:
A type of currency where, hear me out this is gonna get ~ economical ~,
the value is derived from the decentralized trust model. That's a #bigbrain
way to say that people think it has value because math and &quot;no one owns it&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NFTs:
These are a great idea, in theory. NFTs are basically (for the most part), a
receipt that points to a piece of art you own. Interestingly, in a lot of
cases you don't own the art. The good part of them is that a cut of every
sale goes back to the artist. On the flip side of that, a lot of major NFTs
aren't made by actual artists, and are just brands looking for a quick buck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handshake and ENS:
These are two separate DNS services for the decentralized web, ignoring that
projects like <a href="https://opennic.org">OpenNIC</a> exist and don't burn the
planet. Handshake is it's own blockchain, where as ENS is a suite of so
called &quot;smart contracts&quot; on the <a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> blockchain.
Both of these are Proof Of Work, which is a system that relies on solving
complex math problems, burning gigawatts of power a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IPFS
This is one of the few pieces of the web3 stack I am genuinely a fan of.
<a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> is a p2p (fancyspeak for 2 computers connecting to
each other without needing someone orchestrating it) network where files are
stored. I'm a fan of this one because it's not tied to some sort of currency
to compensate for storage, you just pin the files you like and want to
support, and can have others pin yours! It's genuinely a great file system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class='imgcontainer'><img alt='A description is directly below this image, prefaced by a tilde.' src="/static/meta.png" /> <p class='image-alt'>~ "metaverse"</p></div>
In your average cryptobros mind, these can all come together to make some sort
of magical metaverse of happy capitalism wonderland.</p>
<h4>Immutable hell</h4>
<p>One thing you might notice is that the majority of these protocols are static,
immutable, or store the entire history. This seems amazing right now, but with
exponentially more users and growth, the storage and compute requirements will
also rise exponentially, which makes sense from a Big Tech point of view, how
else would you sell more CPUs, more GPUs, more RAM, more SSDs.</p>
<h2>A solution: Just stop, like really</h2>
<p><div class='imgcontainer'><img alt='A description is directly below this image, prefaced by a tilde.' src="/static/degrowth.png" /> <p class='image-alt'>~ "degrowth grafiti"</p></div>
Theres's a solution that comes to us from the world of economics. It's called
Degrowth. With our current situation, quite a few people believe that the
solution to our issues with some things like climate change and the hell that is
work in our neoliberal economy. The core concept is moving backwards, slowing
down, and reversing. We can apply this to web3 as well! We need to stop pushing
forwards on things like PoW cryptocurrencies and move back to Web 2 or 1 tech.</p>
<h2>What can I do?</h2>
<p>I have no clue how to end posts, so enjoy this amazing call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just go and like, ya know, steal some bitcoin mining GPUs and use them for
games.</p>
