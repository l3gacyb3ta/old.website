# Design ideas

## Inspiration

This site is heavily inspired by Windows '95 windows and sites like:
- [Fdisk](https://fdisk.space)
- [ZephyrNet Chronicles](https://chronicles.zephyrnet.hackclub.com/arcade/)
- [Xe's website](https://christine.website/)
- [xxiivv](https://wiki.xxiivv.com)

## Philophy 
The site should be accessible, easy to read and as light-weight as possible, to keep the site as environmentally friendly as it can be. It will be static, so the whole thig can be cached. The content will be notes and posts, but motly for myself and those who care to see what I'm thinking about. 

## Language
The naming is based around my ongoing scheme of naming devices and projects based on their relation to me.

I consider my laptop the center of my digital life, so it gets the name Sol. My phone is then Terra, and my headphones Luna. My school laptop is AlphaCentauri and my cloud instance is proxima. So this project being a personal cloud of information that floats around me, it is nebula. The components will be thusly named after nebulae. For example, the SSG is helix and the CLI is carina. 

nebula, helix, and carina are stylized in the lower case.
