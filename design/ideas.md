# Design ideas

## Inspiration

This site is heavily inspired by Windows '95 windows and sites like:
- [Fdisk](https://fdisk.space)
- [ZephyrNet Chronicles](https://chronicles.zephyrnet.hackclub.com/arcade/)
- [Xe's website](https://christine.website/)
- [xxiivv](https://wiki.xxiivv.com)

## Philophy 
The site should be accessible, easy to read and as light-weight as possible, to keep the site as environmentally friendly as it can be. It will be static, so the whole thig can be cached. The content will be notes and posts, but motly for myself and those who care to see what I'm thinking about.
